This library and its documentation reference several established software engineering concepts and design patterns, including:

- Repository, Strategy, and Unit of Work patterns, popularized by the "Gang of Four" (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides) in their book _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_.
- The concept of code smells, referenced from Martin Fowler's work (_Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code_).
- Additional inspiration and guidance from:
  - Eric Evans (_Domain-Driven Design_)
  - Official Microsoft documentation
  - The article ["S.O.L.I.D: The First Five Principles of Object Oriented Design"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) By Samuel Oloruntoba, Anish Singh Walia and Manikandan Kurup on DigitalOcean.
  - The works of Robert C. Martin (_Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_ and _Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design_).
